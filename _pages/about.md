Iâ€™m a joyful and adventurous engineer studying for an MEng degree at University of Cambridge. I am currently in the last year of my degree (graduating in Summer 2026) and I major in aerospace and mechanical engineering. Inspired by my eight-year experience in photography drones, my study and research experience focus on the application of drones for innovative and sustainable uses. My fourth-year project is about miniaturising an aerosol sizing device for a solar-powered UAV in the context of marine cloud brightening (MCB). Prior to commencing study in Cambridge, I spent two years at The University of Hong Kong (2021-2022), where I studied Mechanical Engineering and researched into the use of drones in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL).

I am keen to apply my engineering knowledge to a number of coding, design, and simulation projects. In the last term of my third year, I used MATLAB to optimise wing sections using the panel method and Simulink to design a state-feedback controller for a chemical production plant. Outside of the classroom, I have actively participated in drone, space flight and robotics societies, where many interesting projects take place!
